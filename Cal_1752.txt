in this month 3-13, i.e., 11 days were missing because of :

1). The British Calender which followed the Julian calander was 11 days behind the Gregorian calander & the Britain calander changed from Julian to 	Gregorian caused 11 days skip; 
2). Because of this the people of Britains felt that their life will shorten by 11 days & a moment of "Give Us Our 11 Days" & can be easily found on 	 internet by "LOST 11 DAYS".

The Gregorian calendar is todayâ€™s international calendar, named after the man who first introduced it in February 1582, Pope Gregory XIII. Before 1752, Britain and her Empire followed the Julian calendar, first implemented by Julius Caesar in 46 B.C. However this calendar had an inbuilt error of 1 day every 128 years, due to a miscalculation of the solar year by 11 minutes. This affected the date of Easter, traditionally observed on March 21, as it began to move further away from the spring equinox with each passing year.To get over this problem, the Gregorian calendar was introduced. This is a solar calendar, based on a 365-day year divided into 12 months. Each month consists of either 30 or 31 days with one month, February, consisting of 28 days. A leap year every 4 years adds an extra day to February making it 29 days long.
